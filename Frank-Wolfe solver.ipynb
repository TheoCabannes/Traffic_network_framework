    "Secondly, we solve the STA using links flow. \n",

    "Thirdly, we solve the STA using paths flow. \n",
    "The issue here is that finding every path in a network in a NP-complete problem. \n",
    "But if we can compute every path (we only need to do it one time), then it is really fast to compute the shortest path. We do not need to do a Dikjstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path, only a big matrix multiplication and a array sorting are enough. This might be more difficult on a laptop. But it might be faster on a HPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we solve the STA using links flow and we compute the paths during the all or nothing step of the Frank Wolf algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are capacity constraints, we should be carefull to have a line search resolution which is coherent with the approximation of being at the saturation of a link.\n",
