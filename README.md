# Traffic_network_framework
This code has been written during the Fall 2018 for the project of the EE227BT class at UC Berkeley.

## Motivation
The main motivation of this project is to provide a flow-based traffic framework for research.
Some ideas of research are:
- the impact of traffic incident on network flow
- the test of small routing algorithm
- the test of different traffic assignment simulators
- the see the impact of routing applications on the state of traffic
- to understand how ML/RL could improve traffic routing / traffic modeling

## Data
We use data from https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks
